# Blender SHAR Tools
A blender addon that adds various tools for working with P3D files from The Simpsons Hit & Run. 

This addon currently targets Blender 4.2 and is based on DonutTeam's blender-shar-tools.

The Pure3D classes within this repo are based very significantly upon [LuaP3DLib](https://github.com/Hampo/LuaP3DLib) and the [TypeScript Pure3D Library](https://github.com/donutteam/npm-pure3d).

## Usage
Not even close to ready yet, stay tuned?\
The "main" branch is being developed on, so make sure to update the addon first before reporting an issue.

## Contributing
This fork is ready to be contributed on, I myself don't know if you can make PRs to forks but you can try!
