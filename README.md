# Blender SHAR Tools
A blender addon that adds various tools for working with P3D files from The Simpsons Hit & Run. 

This addon currently targets Blender 4.2 and is based on DonutTeam's blender-shar-tools.

The Pure3D classes within this repo are based very significantly upon [LuaP3DLib](https://github.com/Hampo/LuaP3DLib) and the [TypeScript Pure3D Library](https://github.com/donutteam/npm-pure3d).

## Installing
Download the repo with Git or click on "Code" -> "Download ZIP" at the top.  
Copy/move the "src" directory to:
- Windows: `~\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.2\scripts\addons`
- Linux: `~/.config/blender/4.2/scripts/addons`

Make sure to **replace the version number** with the latest one and **create the subdirectories** if they don't exist.  
You can rename the "src" directory if you want.

I may come up with a more intuitive guide for installing the addon.

## Usage
Not even close to ready yet, stay tuned?  
The "main" branch is being developed on, so make sure to update the addon first before reporting an issue.

This fork is ready to be contributed on, I myself don't know if you can make PRs to forks but you can try!
